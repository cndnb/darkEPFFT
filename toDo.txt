Reformat design matrix so that entire dataset Y = days x frequencies is compared to a matrix that is the fft
of a unit amplitude specific frequency with interval 1/datalength.

Resize both the data array and the design matrices so they are n x 1 matrices => single scalar amplitude output.

Components to look for are
sin(wt)
cos(wt)
sin(wt)cos(w_e t)
cos(wt)cos(w_e t)

because perpX and paraX are degenerate.
